            <h2><i>#Pepperoni Pizza</i></h2>
            <p><h3>-Pepperoni pizza has a robust and flavorful taste that is slightly sweet, smoky, and spicy1.
                <br>- The salty notes come from the curing process as well as the addition of spices like garlic and black pepper12. 
                <br>- recipes may also call for additional spices like paprika or oregano to give it an extra kick of flavor1.
